# Converzone

Converzone has been created initally as a school project by Matthias Schwarzl and Goga Barabadze. Credits also go out to Samiran Erlacher, Stefan Schl√∂gelhofer and Lukas Kaltenberger for their help and support, especially during the start phase.


## General

The platform is meant to connect people from all around the planet by encouraging and supporting cultural and linguistic exchanges between individuals. The app let's you enter the languages you speak and the languages you want to learn. Afterwards, it shows you people with compatible interests as you. The platform is a 100% free and mostly open-source. The backend is being developed with Google Firebase.


## Help developing
If you want to start developing, please send us an email to goga.barabadze73@gmail.com for us to give you a demo account for the platform.
The source code has been commented in the relevant places but a prior advanced knowledge with Swift and Design Patterns is highly suggested.
If you want to help develop the Backend as well, please, also send an email to goga.barabadze73@gmail.com. Since the backend handles important data, only people with much experience will be allowed to work on it.

It is also important to note that many components of the iOS-Version of the app have been split into several repositories which are not all public.
